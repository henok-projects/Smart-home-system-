## Networking
## ====================
##
## Related doc guide: https://rabbitmq.com/networking.html.
##
## By default, RabbitMQ will listen on all interfaces, using
## the standard (reserved) AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 port.
##
listeners.tcp.default = 5672



## It is possible to disable regular TCP (non-TLS) listeners. Clients
## not configured to use TLS and the correct TLS-enabled port won't be able
## to connect to this node.
# listeners.tcp = none
# Galsie Note: Should disable non-tls in the future and enforce tls on all clients



## Set the server AMQP 0-9-1 heartbeat timeout in seconds.
## RabbitMQ nodes will send heartbeat frames at roughly
## the (timeout / 2) interval. Two missed heartbeats from
## a client will close its connection.
##
## Values lower than 6 seconds are very likely to produce
## false positives and are not recommended.
##
## Related doc guides:

## * https://rabbitmq.com/heartbeats.html

##
# heartbeat = 60

## Set the max permissible size of an AMQP frame (in bytes).
##
# frame_max = 131072

## Set the max frame size the server will accept before connection
## tuning occurs
##
# initial_frame_max = 4096

## Set the max permissible number of channels per connection.
## 0 means "no limit".
##
# channel_max = 128



##
## Resource Limits & Flow Control
## ==============================
##
## Related doc guide: https://rabbitmq.com/memory.html.

## Memory-based Flow Control threshold.
##
## Galsie explains:  This key sets the threshold at which the RabbitMQ will start swapping to disk. By default, it is set to 0.4 (40% of total available memory).
# vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.4

## Alternatively, we can set a limit (in bytes) of RAM used by the node.
##
# vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute = 1073741824

## Or you can set absolute value using memory units (with RabbitMQ 3.6.0+).
## Absolute watermark will be ignored if relative is defined!
##
# vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute = 2GB
##
## Supported unit symbols:
##
## k, kiB: kibibytes (2^10 - 1,024 bytes)
## M, MiB: mebibytes (2^20 - 1,048,576 bytes)
## G, GiB: gibibytes (2^30 - 1,073,741,824 bytes)
## kB: kilobytes (10^3 - 1,000 bytes)
## MB: megabytes (10^6 - 1,000,000 bytes)
## GB: gigabytes (10^9 - 1,000,000,000 bytes)

## Fraction of the high watermark limit at which queues start to
## page message out to disc in order to free up memory.
## For example, when vm_memory_high_watermark is set to 0.4 and this value is set to 0.5,
## paging can begin as early as when 20% of total available RAM is used by the node.
##
## Values greater than 1.0 can be dangerous and should be used carefully.
##
## One alternative to this is to use durable queues and publish messages
## as persistent (delivery mode = 2). With this combination queues will
## move messages to disk much more rapidly.
##
## Another alternative is to configure queues to page all messages (both
## persistent and transient) to disk as quickly
## as possible, see https://rabbitmq.com/lazy-queues.html.
##
# vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio = 0.5

## Selects Erlang VM memory consumption calculation strategy. Can be `allocated`, `rss` or `legacy` (aliased as `erlang`),
## Introduced in 3.6.11. `rss` is the default as of 3.6.12.
## See https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1223 and rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common#224 for background.
# vm_memory_calculation_strategy = rss

## Interval (in milliseconds) at which we perform the check of the memory
## levels against the watermarks.
##
# memory_monitor_interval = 2500

## The total memory available can be calculated from the OS resources
## - default option - or provided as a configuration parameter.
# total_memory_available_override_value = 2GB

## Set disk free limit (in bytes). Once free disk space reaches this
## lower bound, a disk alarm will be set - see the documentation
## listed above for more details.
##
## Absolute watermark will be ignored if relative is defined!
# disk_free_limit.absolute = 50000

## Or you can set it using memory units (same as in vm_memory_high_watermark)
## with RabbitMQ 3.6.0+.
# disk_free_limit.absolute = 500KB
# disk_free_limit.absolute = 50mb
# disk_free_limit.absolute = 5GB

## Alternatively, we can set a limit relative to total available RAM.
##
## Values lower than 1.0 can be dangerous and should be used carefully.
# disk_free_limit.relative = 2.0
